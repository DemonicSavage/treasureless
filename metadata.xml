    <description>This is a WIP mod, it currently has a lot of problems.
This mod makes it so when you access the boss room before any treasure room, it'll give you the There's Options item temporarily.
I only made this to get acquainted to the mod tools and API. This mod isn't any good.
There is a much better version called Treasureless NG, use that instead.</description>
